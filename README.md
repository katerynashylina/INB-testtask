This project is a TV Show Landing Page: Watch trending movies and TV shows, explore popular genres, discover actors/directors, and register for exclusive access. The test task took me approximately 5.5 to 6 hours to complete.
I enjoyed working with the design in Figma and crafting responsive designs independently. However, I encountered nuances such as optimization requirements and the need to implement new types of styles. Nonetheless, I embraced these challenges and intend to apply my newfound skills in the future.

 ### Technologies Used:
